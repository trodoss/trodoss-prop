<font class="HeaderText">PINTBasic Example #3 - Adding Rooms</font>
<br/>
<br/>
In this example, additional rooms are added to the game.  The startup room code is available <a href="../examples/Example3/0.bas">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<font class="HeaderText">* Déjà Vu?</font>
<br/>
One of the issues you can run into when coding rooms is the situation where an object has been "TAKE"en and you return to the room, and, much to your wonder and amazement, the item is back!  Although that works out great for an "infinite life" scheme... It doesn't work well in an adventure game when you only want an item to be taken/used once.
<br/>
In order to account for this (since there will be multiple rooms in this example), the variable "g_varGameProgress" is used to store the current game progress.  This global/application variable is defined in "<a href="../examples/Example3/gamesetup.bi">gamesetup.bi</a>", along with the CONstants  that are being used to track game progress.
<br/>
<br/>
<font class="HeaderText">* Variables ?!??</font>
<br/>
Yes, the PINT interpreter supports 8 "global" variables, and 8 "local" (room) variables. All the variables used in the PINT interpreter are bytes.  There are some that are pre-defined, and some, like "g_varGameProgress", that can be user defined.
<br/>
<br/>
- The global/application variables will retain their values between rooms.
<br/>
- The room variables only exist while the ego is in a particular room.
<br/>
- Any of the variables will persist if a LOAD/SAVE action is used in a particular room.
<br/>
<br/>
If you look in the "<a href="../examples/Example3/global.bi">global.bi</a>" you will find a section with the PINT (application) pre-defined variables.
<br/>
The following global variables are pre-defined for use in the PINT interpreter:
<br/>
<pre>
     global 0 = max score
     global 1 = current score
     global 2 = last room 
     global 3 = last item selected 
</pre>
<br/>
These are defined as follows in the "global.bi"
<br/>
<pre>
     -----------------
      Dim g_varMaxScore As Byte
      Dim g_varCurrentScore As Byte
      Dim g_varLastRoom As Byte
      Dim g_varLastItem As Byte
</pre>
<br/>
<font class="HeaderText">...Back to The Old Shed:</font>
<br/>
In the "On_Take" event, in the nested If statement you will find the line:
<br/>
<pre>
    g_varGameProgress = GAME_GOT_RAKE
</pre>
<br/>
This assigns the constant ("GAME_GOT_RAKE" or "1") to the g_varGameProgress variable.
<br/>
In the "On_Load" event, there has been an If statement placed around the Load method of "picRake".  If the global variable is set (item taken), then the rake would not be  displayed now when the item is taken and, for example, the Ego enters the old shed.
<br/>
<br/>
<font class="HeaderText">The On_Hotspot[x] Events...</font>
<br/>
Much like other events, Hotspot events are triggered when the Ego is within the boundary of the hotspot. The following is important to remember about hotspot events:
<br/>   
<br/>
 - The first Hotspot defined in a room is Hotspot 1.
<br/>
- Each additional hotspot increments.
<br/>
- The On_Hotspot events are defined by the hotspot "ordinal number," (Meaning 1,2,3,4) rather than  their name reference (ex: "hotRake").
<br/>
<br/>
<pre>
  Event On_Hotspot1
       Room.Load(ROOM_INSIDE_SHED)
  End Event
</pre>
<br/>
If you look in the "<a href="../examples/Example3/rooms.bi">rooms.bi</a>" you will see a list  of constants used to define the rooms.  You will  see these used in the "Room" declaration, where  each room is defined.
<br/>
The "Load" method of the Room object uses the room number when loading the next room.  Once this happens, The current room's code is terminated, and the new room is loaded into the PINT interpreter.
