What Is the PAGE Interpreter Project? 
This project is an adventure game engine in the same style of LucasArt's
SCUMM (Script Utility for Maniac Mansion) and Sierra-Online's AGI 
(Adventure Game Engine) implemented on the Parallax Propeller 
microcontroller. 


Getting Started: 

The current requirements: 
- Propeller board with NTSC video out (using Demo Board configuration) 
- SD card capability 
- Keyboard 

Configure the "PAGE_Main.spin" file to match your setup and compile. In the 
/examples directory you will find several sets of example code and command
line batch files to compile the examples.
