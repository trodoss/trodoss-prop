' ------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to edit the .gbr (font/gfx) and .gbm (map) resources you will need to download/unzip the gbmb18 and gbtd22 applications in the /gfx folder.

The utilities should be available here:
http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html
http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbmb.html

The game_data.txt file is what the FFDataBuilder utility uses to 'build' the data files.  See the file for documentation on how to use the commands.

The FFDataBuilder application uses components from the Graphics Utilities source.  This should be found in the \utils\GraphicsUtilities\ folder.

If you experience problems, please check the source/site to ensure that you have the latest source/build.
